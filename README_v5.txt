Important:
The daily EASA FDP check implemented here is the BASIC acclimatised table without planned extensions,
split duty, augmented crew, commander discretion, unknown acclimatisation or operator-specific FRM.
It is a warning/monitoring aid, not a replacement for the operator's approved FTL scheme.
